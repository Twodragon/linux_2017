# File System
ext2-like File System by Efimochkin Sergey.

In runtime whole file system is also stored in dynamic memory.

Number of files is pre-set as *NUMBER_OF_INODES*.

*NUMBER_OF_CHARS_IN_INDEX* must be less than *NUMBER_OF_BYTES_IN_BLOCK*;  

*NUMBER_OF_BYTES_IN_BLOCK / NUMBER_OF_CHARS_IN_INDEX* preferably should be more than two, or there's practically no point 
in double addressing.


**Supported commands list**

* ls to list files in current directory
* cd *%name%* to go to directory named *%name%*
* mkdir *%name%* to create directory named *%name%*

* touch *%name%* *%file text%* to create a file named *%name%* with text of file *%file text%*
* rmdir *%name%* to delete directory named *%name%* and all files in it
* rm *%name%* to delete file named *%name%* from directory
* read *%name%* to print text of file named *%name%*
* import *%inner name%* *%outer name%* to import file named *%outer name%* from computer's file system and save it as file named *%inner name%* in this file system 
* export *%inner name%* *%outer name%* to export file named *%inner name%* into computer's file system as a file named *%outer name%* 
* save to save all changes made in the filesystem
